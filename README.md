<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Compend is an easy-to-use adventure game compendium for game masters building immersive worlds. Keep track of NPCs, Locations and other details of your world with ease. In my experience as a GM, spreadsheets aren't convenient enough to keep the players focus from drifting while I look up an NPC or Location description. Compend makes it easy to upload your old spreadsheet as a CSV file and link related data so you always have the right info at your fingertips. 
Compend is also designed to work when shrunk down to a fraction of your screen so it won't get in the way of your adventure!

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Bootstrap]()

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Coming Soon

### Prerequisites

Coming soon

### Installation

Coming soon

## Usage

To begin using Compend, you must make an account. Click the "Sign up" button on the homepage and enter your email, a username, and a password. If you need the app to share screen space with other windows, you can scale your browser down to a narrow view and the app will still work!
[![Usage Screen Shot1][usage-screenshot1]](https://example.com)

The main page scaled to 1/5th height:
[![Usage Screen Shot2][usage-screenshot2]](https://example.com)

Next you will find your way to the landing page. Here, you need to create a campaign in which your NPCs and other compendium data will live.
[![Usage Screen Shot3][usage-screenshot3]](https://example.com)

When your campaign is complete, click its icon to view the campaign page.
[![Usage Screen Shot4][usage-screenshot4]](https://example.com)

Now click on one of the tabs and start filling out data for your campaign! Currently NPCs and Location models are supported.
